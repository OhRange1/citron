**Citron is an open-source, performance-focused Minecraft modpack designed to deliver a smooth, responsive, and modern experience for all players. It keeps the game lightweight while refining visuals, optimizing performance, and improving usability — without changing core gameplay.**

Citron aims to give the average player a stable, enjoyable, and efficient Minecraft experience. As newer versions become increasingly bloated, Citron focuses on countering that bloat with continuous optimizations and QoL improvements.

Citron is offered in two branches:

- **Citron Leaf** – pure performance and lightweight optimization  
- **Citron Core** – performance plus QoL enhancements for a modern and refined experience

## Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Manual installation is a **full overwrite** of your current `.minecraft` folder.  
> **Back up all personal data before continuing.**

### Step 1: Download the Manual Zip
Download **Citron [Branch] [MC Version] – MANUAL** from the Citron Modrinth page.

---

### Step 2: Back Up Your `.minecraft` Folder

> **Do NOT move or delete these files:**
> - `launcher_accounts.json`
> - `launcher_profiles.json`
> - `usercache.json`

These files must remain in `.minecraft` so the official Minecraft Launcher can detect your account.

---

### Step 3: Clear the Folder for Extraction
After backing up, your `.minecraft` folder should contain **only** the three account files listed above.

---

### Step 4: Extract the Citron Zip
Extract the downloaded Citron zip file and move **all contents** (such as `assets/`, `mods/`, `config/`, etc.) directly into your `.minecraft` folder.

---

### Step 5: Restore Personal Data
Copy any personal files you want to keep (such as `saves/`, `servers.dat`, `resourcepacks/`) from your backup back into the `.minecraft` folder, overwriting duplicates if prompted.

---

### Step 6: Launch the Correct Version
Open the Minecraft Launcher → select the Fabric version included with Citron → click **Play**.

If installed correctly, Citron will now be loaded.
