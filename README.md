**Citron is an open-source, performance-focused Minecraft modpack designed to deliver a smooth, responsive, and modern experience for all players. It keeps the game lightweight while refining visuals, optimizing performance, and improving usability — without changing core gameplay.**

Citron aims to give the average player a stable, enjoyable, and efficient Minecraft experience. As newer versions become increasingly bloated, Citron focuses on countering that bloat with continuous optimizations and QoL improvements.

Citron is offered in two branches:

- **Citron Leaf** – pure performance and lightweight optimization  
- **Citron Core** – performance plus QoL enhancements for a modern and refined experience
